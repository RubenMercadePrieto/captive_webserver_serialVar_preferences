Motivation: Debug and configure a station remotely 

One of the easiest ways to debug and configure a working ESP32 repotelly is using Wifi Access Point (AP) mode. The idea would be to have a way to place the ESP32 station under maintenance, e.g. using touchscreen, using button, etc, where the station would restart and load the following code designed for maintenance.

1. To easily access the created Wifi AP with a mobile phone or a laptop, we can use a QR code, e.g. https://www.qrcode-tiger.com/?type=wifi
